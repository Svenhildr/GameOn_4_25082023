## :pencil2: **Development Notes**

  I focused mainly on the modal, delving into JavaScript primarily with some HTML tweaks.  
  I also made a few adjustments to enhance responsiveness.  
  In the 'Development Notes' section of the README, I provided detailed insights into the specific changes I made, making it easier for the code review
